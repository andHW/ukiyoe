      // Basic redirect to the home page with hash routing
      // This handles the case where a user lands on a 404 page (e.g., /hyakkei/bad-path)
      // and redirects them to /hyakkei/#/
      
      // Get the base path dynamically or hardcode it if known.
      // Since this is for GitHub Pages primarily, we can use a relative redirect to root.
      // But we need to make sure we don't loop if this page IS the root for some reason (unlikely for 404).
      
      // Let's redirect to the root of the repo (e.g. /hyakkei/)
      // window.location.pathname will be the 404'd path.
      // We want to go to the repo root.
      // Easiest is to just use the known base path '/hyakkei/' or rely on meta refresh.

      // If we are at https://andhw.github.io/hyakkei/foo/bar
      // We want to go to https://andhw.github.io/hyakkei/

      var segmentCount = 0;
